    cariesDescription: `Caries can lead to infections, fractures, dark teeth, failure of dental restorations and even cause
    you to lose your teeth. If they are in advanced condition, or left untreated, more invasive and
    expensive treatments like root canals, crowns or implants may be needed. The sooner you treat them, the
    simpler it will be and more tooth structure we can preserve.`,

    FractureDescription: `Fractures can lead to infections, dark teeth, failure of dental restorations and even cause you to lose
    your teeth. If they are in advanced condition, or left untreated, more invasive and expensive treatments
    like root canals, crowns or implants may be needed. The sooner you treat them, the simpler it will be
    and more tooth structure we can preserve.`,

    SeverelyDamaged: `Severely damaged teeth are at high risk of being lost. These conditions can lead to infections, bone
     loss and even tooth loss if not treated soon. In some cases the tooth can be saved but in many cases the
     tooth needs to be extracted and replaced.`,

    Wear: `Teeth can wear for several reasons. If it progresses it can lead to very short teeth that don’t look
     nice, a poor bite, an older appearance, infections and even tooth loss. Tooth wear may need more
     invasive and expensive treatments like root canals, crowns or even extractions with tooth replacement.
     If treated early these problems can be avoided. You need to stop the cause of wear and protect these
     teeth to prevent further worsening.`,

    PlaqueHygiene: `You have too much accumulation of bacteria in your mouth that cause several problems including gum
     disease, tooth decay, infection and bad breath. Your oral hygiene needs to be improved for your specific
     needs. We will help and explain what you need to do at home to take good care of your teeth, smile and
     breath. There is also increasing evidence that gingival problems due to poor oral hygiene are related to
     other serious problems in the body such as heart, lung and other inflammatory diseases.`,

    Gingivitis: `Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums. Gum disease can lead to infections and bad breath. It can
     progress and lead to gum recession, bone resorption and even tooth loss. The sooner you treat gum
     disease and follow our hygiene advice, the more gum, bone and tooth structures we can preserve and then
     you can keep your teeth healthy and strong for life. There is also increasing evidence that gingival
     problems are related to serious diseases in the body such as heart, lung and other inflammatory
     diseases.`,

    GingivialRecession: `Gingival (gum) recession may have different causes. In many cases gum recession can make your smile look
     older, cause tooth sensitivity and pain. Is left untreated it can progress to further gum recession,
     bone loss and even tooth loss. The sooner you treat the problem and follow our hygiene advice, them the
     more gum, bone and tooth structures we can preserve.`,

    Periodontitis: `Periodontitis is an advanced state of Periodontal Disease or Gum Disease where you already have bone loss 
     around your teeth. It starts with Gingivitis which is inflammation of the gums caused by bacteria. As it progresses to 
     Periodontitis the gum separate from the teeth causing pockets and the bone that supports the teeth is destroyed. 
     Periodontitis can cause bleeding gums, bad breath, older appearance, gum recession, tooth sensitivity while unsupported 
     teeth get loosen and may need to be removed. The bone loss can make the placement of dental implants more difficult. 
     The sooner you treat the problem and follow our hygiene advice, the more gum, bone and tooth structures we can preserve 
     and then you can keep your teeth healthy and strong for life. There is also increasing evidence that gingival problems are 
     related to severe diseases in the body such as heart and lung disease and other inflammatory diseases.`,

    Mobility: `Mobile teeth can be a sign of gum disease, bone loss or excessive bite forces in those teeth. These teeth can 
     be difficult to chew with as they move while you bite.`,

    GummySmile: `This is an esthetic problem where you are showing too much gum while you smile.The good news is that this can 
     be corrected with different techniques according to each case if this is of concern to you.`,

    GingivalOvergrowth: `Gingiva (gum) can overgrow around your teeth for several reasons. It can cause gum inflammation and 
     prevent you from cleaning your teeth correctly. It can also cause you to show too much gum when you smile. The sooner you 
     treat the problem and follow our hygiene advice, them the more gum, bone and tooth structures we can preserve and then you 
     can keep your teeth healthy and strong for life.`,

    LargeMaxillarySinus: `This means you do not have enough natural bone volume to place implants in that area. It can happen due
      to previous tooth loss, bone resorption or simply because your maxillary sinus is too large.`,

    Necrosis: `When your teeth have necrosis it means that you have, or are likely to develop, an infection. These teeth need 
      to be treated to avoid further complications like bone infections, tooth fractures and tooth loss. The sooner you treat it, 
      the higher chances of maintaining the tooth.`,

    ApicalLesion: `There seems to be an infection present in the bone around your teeth. In many cases this can be treated 
      through a Root Canal Treatment. In some cases the lesion needs to be removed surgically. This condition may need to be 
      treated to stop the infection and save the tooth.`,

    RootCanalTreatmentOk: `This Root Canal Treatment you have seems to be in good condition.`,

      bone infections. This problem must be re-treated and in some cases you may need to replace the teeth involved.`,

    RootResorption: `The root of your tooth seems to be resorbing. This may be preventing an effective seal the root and you 
      can develop pain and bone infections. If this progresses you can even lose your teeth. This condition may need to be 
      treated to try to save the tooth.`,

    BrokenInstrument: `There seems to be a broken instrument inside the root of your tooth. In some cases this may be preventing
       an effective seal the root and you can develop pain and bone infections. This problem must be re-treated and in some cases

    Malocclusion: `This technical term means the way your teeth bite together is not ideal. A poor fitting bite may cause or aggravate: - 
    esthetic problems; - unbalanced biting forces between your front and back teeth, causing excessive pressure leading to fractures, 
    wear and other issues; - your jaw muscles and joints may have functional problems causing pain and trouble chewing; - your teeth 
    are more likely to further shifting over time; - more accumulation of bacteria in your mouth which will be more difficult to clean correctly.`,

    ClassIIMalocclusion: `This means your upper teeth are more advanced than your lower teeth when you bite.`,

    MidlineShift: `The midline of your upper or lower teeth is deviated relative to the your lips or to your face. In some cases this 
    can be very noticeable and create an esthetic concern.`,

    CrowdingTilted: `Your teeth are wrongly positioned or overlapping each other, in some areas of your mouth. 
    This can be due to lack of space, shifting movements or tilting caused by the loss of other teeth.`,

    Spacing: `Your teeth seem to have too much space between them, in some areas of your mouth. This can be caused by excessive 
    space in your jaws or due to narrow sized teeth.`,

    FacialDisproportions: `It seems that your face does not have ideal proportions. This can be a minor thing or big issue, depending 
    on the degree it affects you. It can be caused by lost teeth, worn teeth, tilted teeth or a disproportion between your jaw bones.`,

    ConcavePrognathicProfile: `Your lower jaw (chin) is placed too much forward relatively to you upper jaw.`,

    BruxismSigns: `There are signs that you unconsciously grind or clench your teeth. This is called “bruxism” and sometimes it causes pain and 
    soreness in facial muscles and jaw joint problems. Wear and fractures of teeth and dental restorations become common. It can happen during 
    the night or during the day and it can be very intense without you even noticing. Stress and emotional tension are highly related to bruxism.`
